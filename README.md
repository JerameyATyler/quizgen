# quizgen

The Quiz Generator for lack of a better name is a project I built for use in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's CS1 course.
Our lecture is too large to really give a quiz to. So I built this as a proof of concept and a foundation for a couple of
future projects.

Basically this is an XML schema, a Python script, and a CSS stylesheet. By providing a set of quiz questions in the outlined schema the script will create a set of sequentially named HTML pages that can be easily navigated in a lecture setting.

Code is commented and there is a TeX document with the XML schema documentation. If there is interest and I have time I will
put more into this.
